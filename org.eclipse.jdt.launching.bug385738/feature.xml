      version="2.0.0">

   <description url="https://github.com/cchabanois/eclipse.jdt.debug">
      Contains a patched eclipse.jdt.launching plugin :
It creates a classpath only jar on Linux when classpath is longer than 131072 (MAX_ARG_STRLEN). This jar is created on the working directory and deleted when process terminates.

MAX_ARG_STRLEN (kernel &gt;= 2.6.23) is the maximum length of a command line argument (or environment variable) and its value is 131072 and cannot be changed without recompiling the kernel.
